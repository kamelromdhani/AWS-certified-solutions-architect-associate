<h3>What is a placement group in Amazon EC2 and why use it?</h3>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer44')">Show Answer</button>
<p id="answer44" class="answer" style="display: none;">
When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload.
</p>

<h3>What are the three placement strategies that can be used when creating a placement group in Amazon EC2?</h3>
<p id="answer1" class="answer">Cluster, Partition, and Spread.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">Show Answer</button>

<h3>What is the purpose of the Cluster placement strategy in Amazon EC2?</h3>
<p id="answer2" class="answer">The Cluster placement strategy packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of high-performance computing (HPC) applications.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">Show Answer</button>

<h3>What is the purpose of the Partition placement strategy in Amazon EC2?</h3>
<p id="answer3" class="answer">The Partition placement strategy spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">Show Answer</button>

<h3>What is the purpose of the Spread placement strategy in Amazon EC2?</h3>

<h3>What is the Session Store pattern in ElastiCache?</h3>
<p id="answer81" class="answer">The Session Store pattern in ElastiCache involves using the cache as a storage mechanism for temporary session data. Instead of storing session data in the application's local memory, it is stored in the cache with a defined Time to Live (TTL). This allows for fast and scalable session management, as the data can be easily shared across multiple application instances.</p>

<h3>What are the different routing policies supported by Route 53?</h3>
<p id="answer85" class="answer">Route 53 supports the following routing policies:
1. Simple: Used for basic routing to a single resource.
2. Weighted: Allows traffic to be split across different resources based on assigned weights.
3. Failover: Used for active-passive setups with a primary and secondary resource for failover scenarios.
4. Latency-Based: Routes traffic to the resource with the lowest latency for the end user.
5. Geolocation: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the end user.
6. Multi-Value Answer: Returns multiple healthy records in a random order to route traffic to multiple resources.
7. Geoproximity: Routes traffic based on the geographic location of the end user and the resources.</p>

<h3>What happens if you don't associate a health check with a Multi-Value Answer record in Route 53?</h3>
<p id="answer86" class="answer">If you don't associate a health check with a Multi-Value Answer record in Route 53, Route 53 will always consider the record to be healthy. Without a health check, Route 53 has no mechanism to evaluate the health of the associated resources. It will assume that all records are healthy and include them in the DNS response.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer86')">Show Answer</button>

<h3>How does the Multi-Value routing policy work in Route 53?</h3>
<p id="answer87" class="answer">The Multi-Value routing policy in Route 53 works as follows:
- When a DNS query is received, Route 53 returns multiple values/resources in the DNS response, each with the same DNS name but different IP addresses.
- Route 53 can associate health checks with the resources, and it only includes the IP addresses of the healthy resources in the response.
- By specifying multiple values, the DNS resolver randomly selects one of the healthy IP addresses, distributing the traffic across the available resources.
- Up to eight healthy records can be returned for each Multi-Value query.
- Multi-Value routing is not a substitute for having an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), but it can be used in conjunction with ELBs to provide a simple form of load balancing.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer87')">Show Answer</button>


<h3>How does the Failover routing in Route 53 work?</h3>
<p id="answer88" class="answer">The Failover routing in Route 53 is used for active-passive failover setups. It works as follows:
- Two or three records are created with the same DNS name but different types: primary and secondary (and optionally, a tertiary record).
- One record is designated as the primary and the others as failover resources.
- Route 53 monitors the health of the primary resource using a health check.
- When the primary resource is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address of the primary resource.
- If the primary resource becomes unhealthy, Route 53 automatically switches the DNS response to one of the failover resources, directing traffic to the backup resource.
- Once the primary resource becomes healthy again, Route 53 switches back to routing traffic to the primary resource.</p>

- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA): Suitable for infrequently accessed data with lower storage costs but higher retrieval costs.
- Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access: Similar to Standard-IA but stores data in a single availability zone, reducing costs but with a slightly lower availability.
- Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Designed for long-term archival with faster data retrieval times.
- Amazon S3 Glacier Expedited Retrieval: Designed for fast data retrieval within minutes from Glacier.
- Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive: The lowest-cost storage class for long-term data archiving with longer retrieval times.
Additionally, Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering automatically moves objects between different storage classes based on access patterns to optimize costs.</p>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer95')">Show Answer</button>

<h3>What is the difference between Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access and Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access?</h3>
<p id="answer96" class="answer">The difference between Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA) and Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA) lies in their availability and storage location.
S3 Standard-IA provides 99.9% availability and is designed for infrequently accessed data. It is stored redundantly across multiple availability zones within a region to provide durability and high availability.

S3 One Zone-IA provides 99.5% availability and is also designed for infrequently accessed data. However, it is stored in a single availability zone within a region, making it less resilient to the failure of that specific availability zone. One Zone-IA offers lower storage costs compared to Standard-IA, but it is recommended for use cases where data durability across multiple availability zones is not a requirement.</p>

<h3>What is a Bastion Host and how is it used in AWS?</h3>
<p id="answer961" class="answer">A Bastion Host is a special EC2 instance that is used as a jump host for SSH access to private EC2 instances in a VPC. It is typically placed in a public subnet and its security group must allow inbound traffic on port 22 from restricted CIDR. The security group of the EC2 instances must allow traffic from the security group of the Bastion Host, or the private IP of the Bastion Host.</p>

<h3>What is a Network Access Control List (NACL) in AWS and how does it work?</h3>
<p id="answer964" class="answer">A Network Access Control List (NACL) in AWS is like a firewall that controls traffic from and to subnets. Each subnet has its own NACL, and newly created subnets are assigned the default NACL. NACL rules have a number, and the first rule match drives the decision. The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match. AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100. Newly created NACLs will deny everything, and NACLs are a great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level.</p>

<h3>What are the 7 CORE CHECKS for the Basic & Developer Support plan in AWS Trusted Advisor?</h3>
<div id="answer169" class="answer">
   <ul>
<li>S3 Bucket Permissions</li>
<li>Security Groups — Specific Ports Unrestricted</li>
<li>IAM Use (one IAM user minimum)</li>
<li>MFA on Root Account</li>
<li>EBS Public Snapshots</li>
<li>RDS Public Snapshots</li>
<li>Service Limits</li>
</ul> 
</div>
<button onclick="toggleAnswer('answer169')">Show Answer</button>


<ul>
  <li>When the new AMI is copied from region A into region B, it automatically creates a snapshot in region B because AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots. </li>
  <li>For Amazon Aurora, each Read Replica is associated with a priority tier (0-15). In the event of a failover, Amazon Aurora will promote the Read Replica that has the highest priority (the lowest numbered tier). If two or more Aurora Replicas share the same priority, then Amazon RDS promotes the replica that is largest in size. If two or more Aurora Replicas share the same priority and size, then Amazon Aurora promotes an arbitrary replica in the same promotion tier.</li>
  <li>a Spot Fleet is a collection of Spot Instances that are automatically launched and managed by AWS to help you optimize costs. The Spot Fleet allows you to request a specific capacity (number of instances) that you need for your application or workload.</li>
  <li>The target capacity in a Spot Fleet refers to the desired number of Spot Instances you want the fleet to maintain at any given time. When you create a Spot Fleet request, you specify the target capacity as part of the request configuration. AWS attempts to maintain the fleet's target capacity as closely as possible, considering the available Spot capacity and your bid price.</li>
  <li>AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) helps you securely share your resources across AWS accounts, within your organization or organizational units (OUs), and with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users for supported resource types. If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can create a resource once and use AWS RAM to make that resource usable by those other accounts. </li>
  <li>You cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances.</li>
  <li>There is no such thing as using Cognito Authentication via Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication for the application. Application-specific user authentication can be provided via Cognito User Pools. Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token.</li>
  <li>Amazon RDS for MariaDB, Amazon RDS for MySQL, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS for SQL Server and Amazon RDS for Oracle support RDS Storage Auto Scaling. RDS Storage Auto Scaling automatically scales storage capacity in response to growing database workloads, with zero downtime.</li>
  <li>You can enable Auto Scaling with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. There is no additional cost for RDS Storage Auto Scaling. You pay only for the RDS resources needed to run your applications.</li>
  <li>No variability around clients that cache IP addresses: Some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods of time. So when you make a configuration update, or there’s an application failure or change in your routing preference, you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP addresses. With AWS Global Accelerator, you don’t have to rely on the IP address caching settings of client devices. Change propagation takes a matter of seconds, which reduces your application downtime.</li>
</ul>
